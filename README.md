# LHL_Final_Capstone_Project


## Project/Goals
***
In this project, we will combine and practice implementing what we have learned throughout this course, including:

* SQL queries using pgadmin
* Cleaning data using python
* Creating an interactive dashboard with tableau
  
  
* Apply your bootcamp learnings into a single end-to-end project: Data retrieval, EDA / cleaning, Statistical modeling (optional), Tableau

* Main deliverable: Tableau dashboard(s) and presentation, Jupyter notebooks if used

  
***

## Files Used
***

* Dataset - https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thedevastator/analyzing-credit-card-spending-habits-in-india
* <img width="405" alt="image" src="https://github.com/gu12934/LHL_Final_Capstone_Project/assets/36687057/99081a6c-18eb-4727-939c-0d089a6dac5c">

***
## Process
* Step 1: Aquire dataset and import into jupyter notebook, clean dataset and export file

* Step 2: Use cleaned file and import into tableau and SQL

* Step 3: Run sql queries to answer questions like top 5: Cities with fraud, which gender has most fraud, what credit card had most fraud

* Step 4: Make an interactive dashboard based on city and date on tableau

* If you click on the city, it will adjust all the other graphs, you can also select specific months to gain insight

## Results
* Mumbai and Bengaluru had greatest spending, 
* Most spending was on bills, food, fuel
* Highest percentage of gold type was in Zira
* Lowest gold card type was in Achalpur
* The highest spend month was in August with a Platinum card
* Greater Mumbai had the highest expense type with Bills and lowest with entertainment
* Greater Mumbai had 14% of the total spending of the whole dataset
* 01/2015 had the highest amount of spending

## Challenges 
***
* It was a challenge to create interactivty on tableau
* had lots of issues creating a db with sql-lite to begin with and running queries
* importing the file from a different folder into cleaning ipynb caused some issues
* streamlit was not working at first, issues with pandas profiling library
* adding a state column in excel online to make the tableau dashboard better

***
## Future Goals
* develop a ML model and make predictions on credit fraud
* compare to other datasets and other spending habits in different countries
* customer segmentation, credit risk, credit fraud detection (anomalies), credit approval projects coming soon
